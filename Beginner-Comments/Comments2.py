# Here we will talk about all of the different data structures that
#  Python offers, Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples, and sets.

# Here are the four different structures that hold a collection of
# of objects. List, Tuple, Dictionary, Set.

# LISTS:

# A list is a ordered data collection data structure
# List - a ordered mutable collection of objects
# Lists are like arrays in other languages, however unlike an array.
# a list does not need to predeclare the size of the list before
# storing objects in it.
# You also don't have to assign a data type youll be using, you can
# place any kind of object into the list in any ordered
# Best of all lists are mutable, in that they can change overtime as
# you see fit, you can add to the list, remove from the list, or
# changing the object in the list, they also shrink and expand as
# you change things in the lists.
# indexed

# TUPLES

# Tuples is an ordered immutable collection of objects
# Meaning that tuples do not change once they set under any
# circumstances (constant list)
# They're like lists accept for the fact that they do not change
# indexed

# DICTIONARIES

# Dictionaries are a unordered pair of key/value
# Unordered however structured
# In a dictionary you have the each value assigned with a unique key
# Any one of the values stored in a dictionary can be any object
# But it will be assigned a unique that identifies that value.
# Dictionaries are unordered are mutable
# Think of a dictionary as a compound key in an database table
# dictionaries can shrink and grow as you need it to.
# The Interpreter does not care how you store the keys and values
# associated with the keys, so don't rely on the Interpreter to
# organize the data for you.

# SET

# Think os sets as a collection of unordered unique objects
# In which no duplicates are allowed

# SETS DO NOT ALLOW DUPLICATED OBJECTS!
# Sets id s dsts structure for holding a collection of related
# objects together, in an unorganized way. This in part is a great
# structure if you need to maintain a lsit of non duplicated objects
# A set is like a box in which you keep all kinds of related objects
# they can shrink and expand depending on what you need. however like
# Dictionaries they do not keep track of the order of objects.
# They also dont keep duplicates of objects.
