# Tuples simply don't change, they're IMMUTABLE
# heres are example of Tuples

vowels = ('a','e','i','o','u')

# If you store a item as a tuple with () you'll actually just get the type
# of whatever you placed in the ()
# ex.
num = (1) # This isn't a Tuple
 # There is a quirk in the language, you can store one item as a tuple
 # ex.
 num = (1,) # This registers as a tuple object because a rule of a tuple is that
 # You need to have at least one trailing comma to make a sequence, therefore a tuple
