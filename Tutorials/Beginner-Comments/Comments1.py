#Now we take a step back and analyze a few things:
# In Python, as in many languages as in Java. From numbers, strings,
# number objects, string objects, methods, modules, etc.

# Every object can be assigned to a variable.
# Meaning everything can pretty much be assigned to a variable.

# Just like in other languages an object can have a 'state' (attributes, values)
# and behaviors (methods)

#Recap!
# 'objects' have 'states' and 'behaviors'
#  anything      attributes     methods

# Note to remember!
# Python can be written in an object oriented language (since everything is an
# object, and behaves like one)
# With classes, objects, instances, etc.
# But you don't have to, Python is object based.
# This means that the language behaves like an object oriented language
# But its not a purely a object oriented language. Which means that Object
# Oriented is optional
